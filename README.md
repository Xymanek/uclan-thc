# uclan-thc

The UCLan THC (Treasure Hunt Challenge) server. Implements the backend of a mobile device-based treasure hunt, and a Javascript based client.

The Treasure Hunt is a fully digitized game where you can create new competitions (categories), specify location-based questions, and then make it available for players.

This provides the foundation used for Code Cyprus (http://codecyprus.org) and the CO1111 module (Computing Skills) at UCLan Cyprus (http://uclancyprus.ac.cy).
